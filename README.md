# RainfallForecast-ARIMA-STARIMA

This project evaluates **ARIMA** (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) and **ST-ARIMA** (Space-Time ARIMA) models for short-term rainfall prediction in **Jawa Timur, Indonesia**. Built using **R** in **RStudio**, it compares these time-series models to enhance climate adaptation in agriculture by analyzing spatial-temporal dependencies to improve forecasting accuracy.
